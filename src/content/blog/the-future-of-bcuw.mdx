Hey, I'm Altie122, the creator and owner of the BCUW. I'm writing this blog post from my perspective because it would be difficult to write it from a team perspective. This project is my pride and joy, and the fact that I have received confirmation that some of the staff of BlossomCraft use this platform makes me so happy. I want to make the platform as good as possible for everyone, and that is where I need to make changes.

## What will the next few months look like for the BCUW?

Currently, BCUW is bouncing between a lot of different ideas and states. V4 was originally going to be the forever platform for the BCUW; however, the build times and the time it takes to create a new item/crate make the current setup unsustainable. Because of this, I've made the decision to start over on [V5](https://v5.bcuw.xyz). I will *NOT* be rushing to get V5 into production. In fact, as of writing this, it still has the default MediaWiki homepage with a small change. I do not plan to have V5 be the production platform for the next few months.

## V5...

In the last paragraph, I mentioned V5 and something called "MediaWiki." I should explain what MediaWiki is. MediaWiki is a wiki platform (I will be referring to it as wiki software for the remainder of this post) that is used by some of the biggest wikis and wikifarms in the world. Some examples of these wikis are Wikipedia, The Minecraft Wiki, Halopedia, and any Fandom wiki. This software is tried and true and way better than the current pieced-together system we have. Although I have loved coding BCUW, I can't make it work as well as I want.

We will be switching to MediaWiki within the year; however, I will not be setting a date until I know for sure that the platform is ready.

## Updates to the current platform

V4 may or may not receive updates; I'm not sure. The biggest thing holding me back right now is the fact that a tool I use to make the screenshots of the item lore has not been updated to work with 1.21. When this tool is updated, I will try to continue working on V4.

That's it for now. I'm keeping this short because I'm tired (it's midnight for me) and need sleep. I hope y'all have a great day/night, and I will talk to you again... someday...
