One of the best things about having the CELESTIAL [paid rank](/ranks#paid) is that you can get a colored rank. However, making one and submitting it can be a bit annoying the first time. So here is a guide to creating your own RGB ranks.

Custom RGB ranks are made using fairly simple tools, but if you want symbols or other special characters, submitting the rank on Discord can be a bit tricky and often breaks.

## Tools
Officially, BlossomCraft suggests using [this tool](https://codepen.io/0biwan/pen/ggVemP) to make ranks. It works, but isn't the best tool I've found as it only supports the basic colors that Minecraft has built-in. It works, and if you want something basic, it's great. If you want a gradient, I would recommend using [RGBirdflop](https://www.birdflop.com/resources/rgb/). This tool allows you to make a gradient that works well as a rank. It offers many more options, only a few of which you'll need to use to create a rank.

When it comes to symbols, I have found that [this website](https://etcgamer.com/minecraft-symbols-emojis/), which AwaitingValhalla posted in the official BlossomCraft Discord, is one of, if not the best, websites to find Minecraft-compatible symbols.

## Making a rank

For this tutorial, I will be remaking my rank (🐉🐉Dovakiin🐉🐉) as an example.

### Step 1: Choose colors and symbols

This is fairly self-explanatory. Choose your colors (in my case, #aaaaaa and #555555—these will be the colors you use for the gradient. Realistically, you can choose as many or as few colors as you want) and your symbols (in my case, I'm only using 🐉).

### Step 2: Enter it into [RGBirdflop](https://www.birdflop.com/resources/rgb/)

This is a very simple step. Just enter your rank name (in my case, 🐉🐉Dovakiin🐉🐉) into the "Input Text" text box, then select your colors. You can do this by clicking one of the existing colors, then pasting or choosing your colors. If you need more than two colors, you can add more by clicking the "+" button or adjusting the color amount number.

It should look something like this when you are done:

<img src="https://utfs.io/f/MUfCHtba5zu7e9qvdB9zXwvQsBGrRSkMJAq9nL0uKtI4Ypg5" className="w-1/2 h-fit rounded-lg float-left m-2" />

Now you can use the formatting options (e.g., bold, italics, underline, etc.). HOWEVER, using underline and obfuscation is not allowed.

Your rank must be between 1 and 15 characters long.

After this step, it should give you something like this:

&#aaaaaa🐉&#9c9c9c🐉&#8e8e8eD&#808080o&#717171v&#636363a&#555555h&#636363k&#717171i&#808080i&#8d8d8dn&#9b9b9b🐉&#aaaaaa🐉

### Step 3: Submit your rank

This may seem like an easy step, but it's easy to mess up. And I have.

First, open Discord, head to the official [BlossomCraft Discord server](https://discord.gg/blossomcraft), and go to the [#support](https://discord.com/channels/766373302721445888/922361528563412993) channel to create a ticket under the "Prefix Changes" category.

It will ask you for three things:
- Username as it appears in-game.
- Rank code.
- Server to deduct money from.

<Aside type='note' title='Note' bottomRounded={false}>
Your first rank will be free, the rest will cost 15k.
</Aside>

When you fill out the form, do so as instructed. If you have symbols, I recommend sending a second message in the ticket channel with your rank in a code box as shown below:

<div className="flex">
<Code
  text={"`&#aaaaaa🐉&#9c9c9c🐉&#8e8e8eD&#808080o&#717171v&#636363a&#555555h&#636363k&#717171i&#808080i&#8d8d8dn&#9b9b9b🐉&#aaaaaa🐉`"}
  theme={solarizedDark}
  language='md'
/>
</div>

To do this, copy this character and paste it around the rank, BEFORE sending the message. This is not required, but it ensures the rank is formatted correctly when an admin adds it.

<Code
  text={"`"}
  theme={solarizedDark}
  language='md'
/>

After that, just wait a little while for an admin to add it, and you're done!
