<span className="mention">@here</span> Server is back up! For our Bedrock players the new port is the default port (19132). Everything should be as you left it. Currently the voting site https://minecraft-server-list.com/server/469971/vote/ is temporarily disabled.

Edit: All voting sites work now!
