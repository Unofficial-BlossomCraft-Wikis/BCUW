Just a quick note on the map reset policy:

The overworld and Nether will **NEVER** be reset. When any new update hit that impact world generation or if the map gets overpopulated overtime, the world border will expand to reflect these changes.

When the End starts to get a bit stale, or when elytra's start becoming too scarce, we will cast a vote to see if players prefer if they want the End to be reset or if they rather have the border expand. Though this won't happen at least for a month plus.
