The BlossomCraft Unofficial Wiki is a community-driven wiki for the BlossomCraft Minecraft server.

As of 1/11/2025, the wiki has been moved into this monorepo setup.

## File Structure

- `client/`: Contains the client-side code for the wiki. Including the website and app.
  - `website/`: Contains the code for the website.
- `server/`: Contains the server-side code for the wiki. Including the API.

## Why is community not in this repo?
The community site is not in this repo due to the fact it has both different goals, and until the community site is supported world-wide, it will be in a separate repo. We do plan on moving the community site to this repo in the future.
