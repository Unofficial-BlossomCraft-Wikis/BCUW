<Aside type='danger' title='Warning' topRounded={false}>
  We are reworking the CDN, some file paths may break or change in the near
  future.
  <br />
  With the new CDN format, we will no longer server any 3D files.
  <br />
  As of 11/11/2024, the old CDN is now outdated, we are working on the rework.
</Aside>

We have a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that we use to host our static assets. This is open to the public for anyone to access.

to access, use this format:

<Code
  text={`https://cdn.bcuw.xyz/2D/<crate>/<file>.<ext>`}
  theme={solarizedDark}
  language='text'
/>

To see all files go to this github repo: https://github.com/Unofficial-BlossomCraft-Wikis/BCUW-CDN

Please double check the path as some files may have extra folders they are contained in.

<Aside type='caution' title='Caution'>
  3D files have be moved to{" "}
  <Code text={`/deprecated/3D/`} theme={solarizedDark} language='text' /> folder
  on 7/14/2024. <br /> This is due to BlossomCraft no longer having their
  texture pack for download, so we can't get new 3d models. <br /> With this 3D
  will not be updated with old items.
